                This website serves to help MHS students know if each school day is a "A" or "B" day. This website was
                created by Ethan Hampton
                when he realized that no one knew what day it was, and it would be helpful to have a website to tell
                you
                about it.
                <br> This website is Progressive Web Application. This means that you can add it to your home screen on
                mobile
                and it will work offline.
                <br>Thank you to Eli Harrison for designing the logo and continuing support of my various endevors! You
                can find
                him on Instagram as @eharr.ison
