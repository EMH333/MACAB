                This website serves to help MHS students know if each school day is a "A" or "B" day. It is my hope that
                this will help you be at the right place at the right time for your high school years.
                This website was
                created by <a href="https://www.ethohampton.com">Ethan Hampton</a>
                when he realized that no one knew if it was an A or B day, and it would be helpful to have a website to 
                figure it out for you.
                <br> This website is Progressive Web Application. This means that you can add it to your home screen on
                mobile
                and it will work offline.
                <br>Thank you to Eli Harrison for designing the logo!
